    has won the greater number of games played against all member Clubs of the League, then
    has the higher winning percentage in all games played against all the other tied Club(s), then
    has scored the higher net aggregate of points (i.e. points scored for less points scored against) in games played against all the other tied Club(s), then
    has scored the higher net quotient of points (i.e. points scored for divided by points scored against) in games played against all the other tied Clubs(s), then
    has the higher winning percentage in all games played against all member Clubs of the Division, then
    has scored the higher net aggregate of points in games played against all member Clubs of the Division, then
    has scored the higher net quotient of points in games played against all member Clubs of the Division, then
